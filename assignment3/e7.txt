1. Only send the position information to the server. The state of world would not be stored in the client anymore.
2. Set the lock/unlock function in e8
3. Fixed the position problem in e8. Use x,y the represent the position inside the div.
4. Fixed some problems in e6 such like if you create a new page, you won't receive the newset states.
