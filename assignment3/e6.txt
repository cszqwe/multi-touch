1. The message which we send is to large. Every time, we would send the whole message about the  world though we just changed the position of only one single component.

2. On the clients(not the server), we just changed the position instead of the world variable. It  is a wrong implemention. Especially when we create a new client, it can leads to some very  obverious bug.

3. Have not locked the component when one is moving it. It is very dangerous to do so.
